# How the Correlations are put together
- GammaJet: input filenames (.x GammaJet <file names>) to create the correlation functions out of data from said filenames
- GammaJet_config: edit in order to set various parameters, usually for cuts on the data
- mixed_cluster_jet: makes gamma-jet correlations with clusters mixed with jets from mixed events, to take a sample of random background
- To subtract the shower shape background and create plots that graph multiple curves (histograms, correlations, etc.) on one plot, go to the histogramcombiner folder
