## Photon data folder
# Technical specifications
- photon_analyzer: the macro that takes data from the THnSparses and returns 2-D histograms of lambda vs. energy data
- photon_projector: the macro that takes data from the root files generated by photon_analyzer and returns graphs of lambda vs. photon enrgy data projected over energies between 6 and 8 GeV
- Last_THnSparses_062017_output: the folder that contains the output from THnSparses_062017 right before it was replaced by THnSparses_062717. Includes No cuts (The folder with the only data which is not cut to a certain bound of asymmetry, matched tracks, angle, and Ncells. This folder has no corresponding source code). 
- 1sigma, 2sigma, 3sigma: the folders with the data whose mass is cut to within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations from the mean, respectively
