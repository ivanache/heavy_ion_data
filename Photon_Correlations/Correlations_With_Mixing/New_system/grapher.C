// Usage: Insert file name as the first argument, number of rows and columns in the canvas are next, followed by all of the histograms. Syntax for histogram insertion: there is one argument per canvas to be created, with a limit of 4 canvases. For graphs within a canvas: ; delimits graphs and , delimits histograms
