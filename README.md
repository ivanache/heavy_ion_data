General Info
- Heavy Ion Data is a simple, basic data analysis tool designed to analyze collision data from heavy ion collisions to make it easier to draw conclusions from the data 
- Depends heavily on CERN's data analysis framework ROOT
- Uses LaTeX to generate report files and to put data on an easy-to-read surface
- Currently, the program is incomplete, so errors may occur and all users are assumed to understand this fact
