# heavy_ion_data
Heavy Ion Data Version 1.1
Creator: Ivan Chernyshev, June 20 2017

## General Info
- Heavy Ion Data is a basic data analysis tool designed to analyze collision data from heavy ion collisions to make it easier to draw conclusions from the data 
- Depends heavily on CERN's data analysis framework ROOT
- Uses LaTeX to generate report files and to put data on an easy-to-read surface
- Outputs data as graphs in ATLAS style
- Currently, the program is incomplete, so errors may occur and all users are assumed to understand this fact 

## Techical Specifications
- Pion Data: the folder with all of the data that is directly from pions
- Photon_data: the folder with all of the data that is about the photons with shich the pions are measured
- Presentations: the folder with previously-presented presentations
- old: a storage compartment for data created by older versions of the code, as well as old versions of the code
- atlasstyle-00-03-05: the folder with the libraries for ATLAS's style
- THnSparses: the data format from where the data is drawn. Versions include (in order of release): Ntuple.root, THnSparses.root (not in use), THnSparses_060717.root, and THnSparses_062017.root (first one to be used outside of Pion Data)

## Guide to working with heavy_ion_data
- To start, start up ROOT by entering "root" into Terminal after navigating to the desired directory (make sure that you have ROOT 6 installed and hooked up to Terminal). 
- To view the data inside a THnSparses, first enter the constructor TFile* <file object (your choice) name here> = new TFile(<insert the name of the THnSparses here (make sure you are in the THnSparses's directory)>);. Alternatively, you may enter the name of the THnSparses right after the "root" command when you launch ROOT. Then enter the command TBrowser* <insert the name of the browser object (your choice) here> = new TBrowser();. A  Browser window will pop up, and your THnSparses will be one of the files on the menu to the left. Click on it to access the data inside.
- To run a macro (one of the C++ programs which processes the data), type in .x <enter macro name here, followed by any arguments that the macro requires>.
