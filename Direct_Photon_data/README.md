# Direct_Photon_data
## Technical specifications
- THnSparses_070517.root: the first direct source of the data and the only current source of data for Cut Comparisons
- THnSparses_071217.root: the current direct source of the data for Modeler
- auto_run.C: the macro that auto-runs all possible combinations of the other macros
- atlasstyle-00-03-05: the folder with all of the atlas style libraries
- old: files that are probably not going to be currently used

### Cut Comparisons, the part of the program that is responsible for comparing data with different distance to bad cuts and distance to botder cuts
- photon_grapher.C: the macro that graphs the data for both the photon spectra and the ratios between data of various distance to border and distance to bad cells cuts
- ratio_combiner: the LaTeX beamer that combines spectra and ratio plots from all data folders
- 0.1<lambda<0.4: the folder with data that has been cut to 0.1<lambda<0.4
- 0.4<lambda: the folder with data that has been cut to 0.4<lambda
- 4<pT<20, 10<pT<20: folders inside 0.1<lambda<0.4 and 0.4<lambda which contain data whose transverse momentum range is 4-20 GeV/c and 10-20 GeV/c, respectively

### Modeler, the part of the program that is responsible for examining the photon data in order to find out how many photons are in the sample
- photon_modeler.C: the macro that graphs and examines the pion data spectrum. Initially based on a specific iteration of photon_grapher.C from Cut Comparisons
