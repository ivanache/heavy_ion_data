# Direct_Photon_data
## Technical specifications
- THnSparses_070517.root: the first and only current direct source of the data
- photon_grapher.C: the macro that graphs the data
- ratio_combiner: the LaTeX beamer that combines spectra and ratio plots from all data folders
- 0.1<lambda<0.4: the folder with data that has been cut to 0.1<lambda<0.4
- 0.4<lambda: the folder with data that has been cut to 0.4<lambda
- 4<pT<20, 10<pT<20: folders inside 0.1<lambda<0.4 and 0.4<lambda which contain data whose transverse momentum range is 4-20 GeV/c and 10-20 GeV/c, respectively
- atlasstyle-00-03-05: the folder with all of the atlas style libraries
- old: files that are probably not going to be currently used
